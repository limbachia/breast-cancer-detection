# Breast Cancer Detection

Predicted tumor malignancy with 98% accuracy and 95% sensitivity. Leveraged radiographic information summarized in the form of 32 features to learn class separability.
Performed data visualiza on and PCA to identify features most predictive of malignancy. Selected best model by performing nested, K-fold cross-validation.
Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PCA, Random Forest, Logis c Regression, Suppor Vector Machines.
